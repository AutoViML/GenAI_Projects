10	I'm trying to find a traditional Chinese recipe that uses chicken, but not just any chicken recipe. I want something with a rich, dark sauce, maybe something that's been braised or slow-cooked. I also have some dried mushrooms, specifically wood ear mushrooms. It should be a dish that's comforting and hearty, something that would be perfect for a cold winter evening. I'm open to using soy sauce and a touch of rice wine, and I'd prefer if it wasn't too spicy. I'm thinking of a dish that would go well with steamed rice, and I'd like to know if there are any variations that include chestnuts or bamboo shoots.
